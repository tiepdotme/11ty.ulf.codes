[WebAIM](https://webaim.org), which stands for *Web Accessibility in Mind,* provides an online [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/), which is 

<blockquote>… a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content.

I find it´s providing very good assistance to structure a website in an accessible way.
