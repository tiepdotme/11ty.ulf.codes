title: Accessibility
---
Through a [post from Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/an-accessibility-statement/) I got drawn into the accessibility topic. Website accessibility was not on my radar until then and that is not good. I want to explore this field, develop my skills and make better *– accessible –* websites.

## Why accessibility matters to me

- **It´s possible:** As web developers we work with a medium that allows to provide content to people who cannot access the same content in other ways, like for example by reading a book. Through the technology it´s possible to include more people and give them access to content. I think that´s a very good thing and consequentially, as web developers it´s our responsibility to work towards inclusion and make use of what is state of the art. We should be concerned that [web accessibility got worse during the last twelve months](/journal/website-accessibility-got-worse/).
- **Our abilities change:** Dont´t think of enabled and disabled people as being two separate groups and, of course, you as a web developer are among the enabled. The truth is, *our abilities degrade over time.* When thinking about accessibility, *think about your future self!* Your field of vision will degrade and you might develop motoric difficulties which make it hard to handle a mouse or trackpad properly. You will get slower in understanding and your attention span might be reduced. Getting in the most easy and direct way to relevant content will become more important for your future self than it is today. How will your future self handle the clever website you are building right now?
- **Site design improves:** Striving for a direct and frictionless path to relevant content improves website design in general. Thus, making the content of a site more accessible will improve the overall site design. 
- **Design process improves:** Accessibility is not something to put on top of an already completed site design. It must be part of the entire design process from the start. I believe the very best approach is to collaborate during the full process cycle with diverse people who have disabilities in one or another way – that could be *real inclusive design.* 
- **The web improves:** The accessible web is a better web. The more web designers start to learn and think about accessibility, the better our web will be.
- **Improve your professional self:** We as web developers are building things for the web. We are deep into the technology. Things that are easy to achieve for us by using a computer are not so easy for most other people! Making accessibility a default skill in our developer toolbox is helping us coming down to earth, and to make the things we are building more usable.

## What do I have to accept

To imagine my future self as someone who is not so quick anymore is one thing, but it must be a different experience of really being able to see the contents of a page and still navigating the web. I don´t have that experience and it´s frightening me. Considering how many years it took me to develop an desired direction, an understanding and a style for my website designs, I have to accept that it takes probably years to develop the necessary skills to build accessible websites. If I can say so, I´m not a *native* in that field and I believe the results of my work will reveal that.

## What do I want to do about it

I want to start improving now. Here is my plan: I focus on the topic of accessibility 

- by identifying people who have something to say about it, 
- by reading more about it, 
- by applying best practices in my own work – at first I will try things out on my personal site here,
- by finding resources to test for accessibility.

I will maintain a list of useful things, like articles, tools, or techniques. I hope, through that I will make accessibility more accessible for myself and something will grow out of it.
