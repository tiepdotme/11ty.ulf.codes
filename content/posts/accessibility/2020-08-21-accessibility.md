title: Accessibility
---
Through a [post from Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/an-accessibility-statement/) I started thinking about accessibility. I have to admit, accessibility was not on my radar as a web developer and that is not good. I want to explore this field further, develop my skills and make better websites which are more accessible.

## Why accessibility matters to me

- **It´s possible:** As web developers we work with a medium that allows to hand out content to people who cannot access the same content in other ways, like by reading a book, for example. Through the technology it´s possible to include more people and broaden the access to content. I think that´s a very good thing and consequentially, as web developers it´s our responsibility to level up inclusion and make use of what is state of the art. We should be concerned that [web accessibility got worse during the last twelve months](/journal/website-accessibility-got-worse/).
- **Our abilities change:** It´s benefitial to not think of enabled and disabled people as being two separate groups and of course you as a web developer are among the enabled. The truth is, *our abilities degrade over time.* When thinking about accessibility, *think about your future self!* Your field of vision will degrade and you might develop motoric difficulties which make it hard to handle a mouse or trackpad properly. You will get slower in understanding and your attention span might be reduced. Getting easy to relevant content will become more important for your future self than it is today. How will your future self handle the clever website you are building today?
- **Site design improves:** Making it as simple as possible to get to relevant content improves website design generally. Therefore I think, making the content of a site more accessible will improve the overall site design. Accessibility is not something to put on top of an already completed site design. It must be part of the entire design process from the start. I believe the very best approach is be to collaborate during the entire design process with people who have disabilities in one or another way – that would be *real inclusive design.* 
- **The web improves:** A more accessible web is a better web. The more web designers start to learn and think about accessibility, the better for our web.
- **Don´t be trapped in our nerd bubble:** We as web developers are building things for the web. We are deep into the technology. Things that are easy for us to do with computers are not so easy for most others! Making accessibility a default for our toolbox is helping us coming down to earth and make more usable things.

## What do I have to accept

To imagine my future self as someone who is not so quick anymore is one thing, but it must be a different experience really being blind now, for example, and navigating the web. I don´t have that experience. Considering how many years it took me to develop an understanding and a style for my website design, I have to accept that it takes probably years to develop the necessary skills to build accessible websites. 

## What do I want to do about it

I want to start improving now. Here is my plan: I focus on the topic of accessibility 

- by identifying people who have something to say about it, 
- by reading more about it, 
- by applying best practices in my own work – at first I will try things out on my personal site here,
- by finding resources to test for accessibility.

I will maintain a list of useful things, being it articles, tools, or techniques. I hope, through that I will make accessibility more accessible for myself and something will grow out of it.
