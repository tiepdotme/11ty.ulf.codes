Terrifying. Watch "[Damascus, USA](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/093660-000-A/damascus-usa-der-gau/)." Some quotes from the film:

> Nuclear weapons will always carry the risk of an unwanted detonation. It will happen: Maybe tomorrow, or in a million years. But it will happen.

> Nuclear weapons are machines. With any machine that has been invented so far, at some point something goes wrong. 

> It´s not clear to the people that we still have 7000 nuclear weapons. It´s not a thing of the past. They are all over the place.

> Nuclear accidents exist today. There are not as much as in the past, which is partly because there are not as many nuclear weapons as in the past. On the other hand the level of control and attention is reduced because people don´t worry about a nuclear war as much as in the past.
